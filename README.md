## Movie-Recommender
#### About this project
- This project is a movie recommender system built using the [IMDB 5000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). 
- The dataset contains information about movies and their cast, directors, storyline, ratings and trailers. 
- The recommender system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend movies based on the user's preferences.
- Built the web app using Streamlit and deployed it on Heroku.
- You can take a look at the [interactive demo](https://imdb5000-movie-recommender.herokuapp.com) to see how the recommender system works. 
- Will update the interface and the layout of the project in the future.
