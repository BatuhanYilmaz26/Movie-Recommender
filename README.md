#### About this project
- This project is a movie recommender system built using the [IMDB 5000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). 
- The dataset contains information about movies and their titles, release dates, cast, directors, storylines, ratings and trailers. 
- The recommender system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend movies based on the user's preferences.
- Retrieved the movie trailers for recommended movies dynamically, using [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).
- Built the web app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and deployed it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
- You can take a look at the [interactive demo](https://imdb5000-movie-recommender.herokuapp.com) to see how the recommender system works.
